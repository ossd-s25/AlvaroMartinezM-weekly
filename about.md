# About Me

Hi! I'm **Alvaro Martinez**, a Computer Science major with a minor in Business and Management at NYU. I'm passionate about software engineering, data analysis, and crypto currencys. 

Currently, I'm taking **CSCI-UA 480 (Open Source Software Development)** for the Spring 2025 semester, where I'm exploring various aspects of open-source contribution and collaborative software development.

### Hobbies & Interests

When I'm not coding, I enjoy:

- Playing soccer and volleyball 
- Playing chess and video games  
- Learning new languages (currently improving my Italian ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹)
