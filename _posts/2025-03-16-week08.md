title: "Week 8 - Reflection on Open Source AI Definition Presentation"
---

## Introduction
This week in our Open Source Software Development class, we had a presentation on the **Open Source AI Definition** by Nick Vidal from OSI. Although a second presentation was cancelled, Vidal’s talk provided plenty of insights worth reflecting on.

## Key Takeaways
I was surprised to learn that open source AI goes beyond just releasing code. Vidal explained that for AI, true openness includes sharing datasets, model training processes, and methodologies to ensure reproducibility and transparency. This broadened my view of what "open source" should entail.

## Changing Perspectives
Before the talk, I thought the financial industry would stick with proprietary systems due to regulation and competition. However, I now see that open source AI is gaining traction in finance as a tool for boosting innovation and security. This shift in perspective makes me optimistic about future applications of open source principles in traditionally closed sectors.

## Conclusion
Overall, Nick Vidal’s presentation challenged my assumptions and sparked my interest in the complexities of open source AI. It’s clear that achieving real openness in AI requires a more comprehensive approach, one that balances transparency with ethical and privacy concerns.
