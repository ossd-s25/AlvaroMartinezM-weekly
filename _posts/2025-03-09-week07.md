## Getting Started  
Our exploration into open source development has been an eye-opening experience so far. My team and I have spent time understanding the broader landscape of open source projects and what we want to achieve. Through brainstorming sessions and research, we collectively discovered the project we want to focus on.

## How We Chose Our Project  
After evaluating several options, we decided that **Oppia** best aligns with our interests. Rather than selecting the most popular project, we focused on one that offers a blend of innovative learning tools and a supportive community. We spent time analyzing project goals, community engagement, and technical challenges before coming to a decision.

## Challenges Along the Way  
Every new venture has its hurdles, and ours was no exception:
- **Navigating Complexity:** Oppia’s robust codebase and extensive documentation posed an initial challenge. The volume of technical details required us to adopt new strategies for learning and comprehension.
- **Team Synergy:** Establishing an effective workflow was tricky at first. We encountered moments of miscommunication and occasional overlaps in responsibilities.
- **Time Constraints:** Balancing project demands with academic schedules has tested our time management skills, prompting us to rethink our planning strategies.

## Our Action Plan  
To overcome these challenges, we’ve adopted a few key strategies:
- **Enhanced Communication:** We’re now holding more frequent check-ins and using collaborative tools to ensure everyone is on the same page.
- **Defined Roles:** Each team member is focusing on specific areas of the project, allowing us to work more efficiently without stepping on each other's toes.
- **Incremental Learning:** Instead of trying to grasp everything at once, we’re breaking down the project into smaller, more manageable segments. This not only reduces the feeling of being overwhelmed but also helps us make steady progress.

## Looking Ahead  
Our next steps involve deepening our understanding of Oppia’s infrastructure and identifying where we can contribute most effectively. With clear roles and a structured plan in place, we’re confident in our ability to navigate further challenges and grow both as developers and as a cohesive team.
