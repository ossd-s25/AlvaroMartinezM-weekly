# Quick Notes: Building a Firefox Browser Extension  

## Idea  
For this weekâ€™s project, we created **Quick Notes**, a browser extension for Firefox that functions as a simple notepad. It allows users to quickly jot down and save notes without leaving their browser, making it a convenient tool for productivity.  

## Group Members  
- Alvaro Martinez  
- Lu Haocheng  
- Xu Yufeng 

## Progress  
We started by outlining key features and researching how to implement storage in Firefox extensions. Initially, we used `localStorage`, but to ensure notes persist across sessions, we switched to Firefoxâ€™s `storage.sync` API. Debugging manifest permissions and handling extension settings were also challenges we had to tackle.  

To stay organized, we divided tasks based on our strengths and communicated through GitHub Issues and group chats, ensuring smooth collaboration.  

## Contributions & Takeaways  
My main contributions were designing the UI and debugging issues related to note saving. My teammates focused on documentation and optimizing the extensionâ€™s structure. Through this project, I discovered that I enjoy debugging more than expected and gained valuable experience working in an open-source team.
