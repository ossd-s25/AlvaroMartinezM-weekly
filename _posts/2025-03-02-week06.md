title: "Week 6: Contributions"
---

Contributing to open source has been an interesting and rewarding experience. While my contributions have been small, they’ve given me a new perspective on how collaborative efforts shape public resources. Over the past few weeks, I’ve been focused on improving OpenStreetMap by adding locations to help enhance the accuracy of its mapping data.  

## What I’ve Done So Far  

### OpenStreetMap Contributions  

- **Domino Park Ice Rink (Feb 15, 2025)**  
  I added one of my favorite places in the city: the new ice rink at Domino Park. Since it’s a recent addition, it wasn’t yet on the map, and I wanted to make sure it was available for anyone looking for it.  

- **Brooklyn Padel Club (Feb 22, 2025)**  
  I created the location for a new padel club in Brooklyn. I think this spot is amazing and deserves more recognition, so I wanted to ensure it was properly documented.  

- **Asian Restaurant (March 2, 2025)**  
  I added one of my favorite Asian restaurants to the map. I’ve visited this place often, and I was surprised it wasn’t listed. Now, more people can discover and enjoy it.  

## Challenges and Lessons Learned  

One of the biggest challenges in making these contributions was ensuring accuracy. OpenStreetMap relies on contributors to provide precise information, so double-checking locations, names, and details is essential. Another challenge is realizing that even though these changes seem small, they still contribute to the larger goal of making maps more reliable and useful.  

## Most Proud Contribution?  

I’m most proud of adding the **Brooklyn Padel Club** to the map. Padel is growing in popularity, but many places aren’t well-documented yet. By adding this location, I hope more people can discover and enjoy the sport. Even though this is my most proud contribution as of right now I want to create better and more complicated contributions as I specify in the next part of my blog.

## Looking Ahead  

Moving forward, I want to make more frequent contributions, whether through OpenStreetMap or other beginner-friendly open-source projects. Even small updates like these help improve public resources, and I’m excited to continue exploring different ways to contribute to the open-source community.
