title: "Week 15 – Oppia Presentation and Final Takeaways"
---

## Introduction  
This week in our Open Source Software Development class, our team presented our final work on Oppia. It was a great way to reflect on everything we’ve built this semester and share how we incorporated feedback from Professor Joanna throughout the project.

## Oppia Project Wrap-Up  
Even after presenting, we’ve continued working on Oppia. We added a few new lessons and helped with translations to expand access to more learners. It’s been cool to see how much our contributions have evolved—from small bug fixes to full lesson modules and content updates.

Going through our slides made us realize how much we’ve grown as a team. We learned a lot about working with a large codebase, managing version control, and making meaningful open source contributions that go beyond just writing code.

## Reflections on Class Presentations  
Watching the other teams present showed how many different ways open source can be approached. Some groups focused on technical improvements, while others emphasized user experience or educational content. It was inspiring to see such variety and creativity.

We also related to the other Oppia group—they ran into similar issues with merging changes and navigating the community’s feedback system. It was helpful to hear how they handled those challenges.

Overall, this week highlighted that open source is about more than code. It’s about collaboration, problem-solving, and making a positive impact in whatever way you can.
