title: "Week 10 - Reflection on Project Progress and Open Source Presentation"
---

## Overview
This week marked our return after spring break, and it was a refreshing change of pace. I spent part of my break soaking up the sun in Miami—an amazing escape that recharged my batteries with its vibrant energy and laid-back atmosphere. Now, with classes back, we dove right into our group work session on Monday, where we shared updates on our projects. Then on Wednesday, we had a guest speaker discuss his journey in open source, offering a fresh perspective on how contributions can shape a rewarding career in tech.

## Group Work Reflections
Currently, my team is tackling the Oppia project. Everyone has been assigned a specific issue, and we’re all working on our parts independently. Getting the development environment up and running was a bit of a struggle at first—there were configuration challenges and dependencies that took a while to sort out. However, after some trial and error, we managed to set it up successfully. This initial hurdle taught us the importance of patience and collaboration, as sharing tips and troubleshooting together really made a difference.

## Presentation Takeaways
The guest speaker this week brought a dynamic and relatable take on navigating the open source world. He emphasized that building a career in open source isn’t just about writing code—it’s about continuously learning, embracing challenges, and being an active part of a supportive community. His journey, from grappling with initial setbacks to making meaningful contributions, inspired me to see every challenge as an opportunity for growth. The talk reinforced that persistence, coupled with a willingness to collaborate and learn from mistakes, is key to carving out a path in the open source arena.
